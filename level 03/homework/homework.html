It was founded on November 29, 1899, by a group of Swiss, Catalan, and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club is one of the most successful and famous football clubs in the world. 

    The club's home stadium, Camp Nou, is the largest football stadium in Europe, with a capacity of over 99,000 spectators. It has been the home of FC Barcelona since its opening in 1957. Barcelona's traditional colors are blue and garnet, giving rise to the nickname "Blaugrana."
    
    Over the years, FC Barcelona has achieved significant success in both Spanish and international football. The club has won numerous La Liga titles, Copa del Rey trophies, and UEFA Champions League titles. Barcelona's playing style, often associated with possession football or "tiki-taka," is highly regarded for its emphasis on short passing and movement.
